# Elevate Fitness - Final Capstone Project
The goal of this application was to track certain aspects of health and provide the user with data regarding their:
  - hydration,
  - weight and
  - food intake.  

To use this application, one inputs their current height and weight. They also input their actual amount of water intake, weight goal and daily food intake.  

The application will calculate the recommended water intake and present a graph comparing the actual water intake with the recommended amount.

Another graph will track the users’ current weight with their goal weight. The graphs for both weight and hydration will display data by the day, week and month.

Finally, the application will track the user’s daily food intake and display a graph of the total caloric intake for the day broken out by percentages of fats/carbs/proteins.
